## Homework 2 - Synchronization: Semaphores and critical section implementation

You are expected to write a C program using threads and semaphores to implement critical
sections.

First, copy the following shell script into a new.sh file. When executed, it will create a new
directory and fill it with 20 - 30 files, each containing 1000 random integers.

```
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf myDir
mkdir myDir
cd myDir
for i in $(seq 1 $((21+RANDOM%10))); do
for j in $(seq 1 $((RANDOM%1000))); do
echo $RANDOM >> file$i.txt
done
done
cd ..
```

You must design your program to accept two parameters from command line, the directory
containing generated txt files (myDir) and the number simultaneously active threads.

Your program must first open the directory passed to it as a command line argument (for
example, “./hw2 directoryName threadNumber”). The program is to use threads to compute the
number of prime numbers in each file and print thread by thread. The number of active threads
at a time is to be limited to threadNumber.

Execute your program observing time data:

```
time ./hw2 myDir 1
time ./hw2 myDir 2
...
```

Note that “time” is a system utility, which displays total execution time details of the executing
program given in the command line.

Let the output of one of the runs be similar to the following.

```
Thread 1 has found 6454 primes in file1.txt
...
Thread 5 has found 23935 primes in file2.txt
…
real 0m54.277s
user 1m48.500s
sys 0m0.044s
```

This sample output shows that this execution took 54.277 seconds.

Repeat the execution for at least 8 times with different number of simultaneously active threads.
Prepare a table showing how the times change with the number of simultaneous threads, similar
to the one as follows:

| THREADS  | REAL | USER  | SYS |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  |   |   |   |
| 2  |   |   |   |
| 3  |   |   |   |
| 4  |   |   |   |
| ... |   |   |   |

As the number of simultaneous threads increase, what changes do you observe for real, user,
and sys values? Explain. You may increase number of files and file sizes by making changes in
the shell script to observe higher variations.

### Hints

* Use a semaphore (mutex) to limit the number of simultaneously active threads
(threadNumber). Create a thread whenever an active thread terminates. Your program must
work for any number of files.

* You may check number of active threads per process by executing “ps -eLf” command in
a second terminal window under NLWP column, after your program starts execution.

You may think of this problem as if an unknown number of students
are queued in front of an instructor’s office to see their exam papers. But he instructor’s office
can only host at most n (threadNumber) students. So, the new student can enter the room, only
when one of the students inside leaves the room.
